# AnsibleWorkshop_July2019

## Information

This is a repository for the Ansible Workshop that will be held in the NetApp Stuttgart office mid-July.
If you are not attending the workshop, you don't really need to look here!

## What is the plan?

We will have a mini-hackathon where we all work on various projects and share our results with each other. 
Try to make one commit per change and commit often, given them comments that make sense. 

If you would like to keep your work together but a bit seperate, make a seperat branch like this:

First cd into the folder "AnsibleWorkshop_July2019" and then: </br>
`git checkout -b [your project or username]`
</br>
If your code editor does not have git integrated you will need go back into the command line and do the following:
</br></br>
`git add .`</br>
`git commit -m “Your commit message here”`</br>
`git push --set-upstream origin [your project or username]`</br>
